This example demonstrates a core feature of Shiny: **AlApe**. In `server.R`, show the form that you can plot a 
simple linear regression with `rCharts` using `mtcars` data set . 

You can choose the explanatory variable and numbers of cylinders for do 
the regression vs dependent variable miles per galon (mpg). Try changing the explanatory variable (using *Choose 
variable*) and change number of cylinders (using *Choose cylinder*). When you choose, the results that you can see 
are a regression graphics with adjusted line, a summary regression where you can see the estimated parameters and 
a general summary with the variables used in the linear regression.
